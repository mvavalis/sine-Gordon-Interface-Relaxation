== Installation notes ==

Download and install deal.II (version 6.3.1 is sure to be compatible).

In the makefile:
--Set variable "DEALIIdir" to the top directory of the deal.II installation.
--As you see, the rule for "shared_lib_export" uses the "export" command.
  If your distribution does not support "export", replace accordingly.
  (It should work on Debian-based systems.)
